Image Painting Classifier
Overview
This project aims to classify two images of paintings, determining whether they belong to the same artist or not. By utilizing deep learning techniques and image processing algorithms, the system can analyze the visual features of paintings and make predictions based on similarities and differences between them.

Motivation
Art authentication and attribution have been longstanding challenges in the art world. This project addresses these issues by leveraging machine learning to automate the process of determining the authorship of paintings. By providing a reliable tool for art experts and enthusiasts, we aim to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of art authentication processes.

Features
